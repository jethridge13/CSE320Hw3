Homework 3

I completed most of the assignment. I did not implement the compilation tags because I ran out of time. (I start early but my understanding of the assignment didn't kick in until later, unforunately. I'll try office hours next time). I completed all of the given functions and they work for the most part but there are a few bugs that persist that remain with the free_list that only showed themselves once I completed coalescing. I felt like the time it would take to debug that would take too long than just a single late day, so I am handing it in as is.
